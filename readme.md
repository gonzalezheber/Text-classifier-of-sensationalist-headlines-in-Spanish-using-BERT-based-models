# Text classifier of sensationalist headlines in Spanish using BERT-based models
## Description
Three text classifiers were built making use of the [ktrain library](https://github.com/amaiya/ktrain) and BERT-based models.
Achieving up to 94% of F1 Score, these classifiers prove once again the good performance BERT-based models can achieve.
More details about them will be available in a technical research report and, possibly, in a chapter of the book *DA&CI 2023: Data Analytics and Computational Intelligence: Novel Models, Algorithms, and Applications*.
This repository contains the code used to fine tune all three models, alongside three CSV files:
+ The data set used to train and test the models
+ A subset, the training set, used to fine tune the models
+ A subset, the testing set, used to validate the models
